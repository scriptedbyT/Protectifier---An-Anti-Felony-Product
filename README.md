# 🛡️ Protectifier - An Anti Felony Product

**Protectifier** is a smart IoT-enabled security system embedded inside a **flooring tile** that detects unauthorized access when the homeowner is away. It’s designed to provide real-time alerts, capture intruder images, and notify the user via a connected device.

Built using an **ESP32-CAM**, **pressure sensor**, and a **siren system**, Protectifier is a compact and effective home security solution.

## 🧠 How It Works

- 👣 **Pressure Sensor** detects pressure when someone/intruder steps on the tile.
- 📸 **ESP32-CAM** captures a live stream and takes a snapshot of the intruder.
- 📡 Sends alert via IoT to the connected local device (mobile, laptop, etc.).
- 🔊 **Siren** is triggered to alert the surroundings.
- 💾 Image of the intruder is stored locally for reference/proof.

> Ideal for smart homes where embedded security is preferred over traditional sensors and cameras.
